# Functional Programming Spreadsheet

The Functional Programming Spreadsheet is a web-based spreadsheet application that allows users to perform calculations and apply functions using functional programming techniques. It supports various mathematical and data manipulation functions, as well as cell references and range operations.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numerical values.
- **Statistical Functions**: Calculate sum, average, median, and more on lists of numbers.
- **Logical Functions**: Check for even numbers, find if any or all numbers are even, and more.
- **Cell Referencing**: Reference cells by their IDs to include them in calculations.
- **Range Operations**: Define ranges of cells and perform operations on them.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors in input formulas.

## Usage

1. Enter data or formulas into individual cells of the spreadsheet.
2. Formulas must start with an equal sign `=` to indicate they are calculations.
3. Supported functions include `sum`, `average`, `median`, `even`, `rand`, and more.
4. Use cell references like `A1`, `B2`, etc., to include values from other cells in calculations.
5. Formulas can include ranges like `A1:B5` to perform operations on multiple cells at once.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Run

To run the Functional Programming Spreadsheet, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that both `styles.css` and `script.js` are present in the same directory.
